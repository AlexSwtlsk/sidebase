# The Scaffold: `fullstack-nuxt3`

This scaffold bootstraps a nuxt 3 project that permits developing a backend and a frontend using just nuxt 3. The application code is inside the `app/` folder. Read more [in it's README](./app/README.md). This scaffold provides out of the box:
- a functional nuxt 3 setup (see in `app/`),
- a drone pipeline for testing
