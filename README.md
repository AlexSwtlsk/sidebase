# The Scaffold

This is the scaffold repository for all of SIDESTREAMs projects.

A scaffold is a foundation for a project that has as many repeating setup-tasks, project-component connections, ... already setup. It's like a baking-set for a cake that then ideally for the cake to come out 
nice you have to add some nice, non-standard things on top. But things like:
- testing setup,
- database ORM,
- database migrations,
- dockerfiles, docker-compose,
- ...

are already done for you.
