# The Scaffold

This is the scaffold repository for all of SIDESTREAMs projects.

A scaffold is a foundation for a project that has as many repeating setup-tasks, project-component connections, ... already setup. It's like a baking-set for a cake that then ideally for the cake to come out
nice you have to add some nice, non-standard things on top. But things like:
- testing setup,
- database ORM,
- database migrations,
- dockerfiles, docker-compose,
- CI/CD setup,
- ...

are already done for you. Each different "flavor" of this scaffold has its own branch, branching off of the main branch. More on this later.

## Usage

To use this in your project:
1. Click "New Repository" using the little pluc icon at the top right
2. At the top click on the select of the "Repository Template" section and select this repository name
3. Check "Include all branches"
4. Finish repository creation

Then in the newly created repository, you have the `main` branch which contains the bare necesseties that _all_ of our project need. In the diverging branches you have more advanced scaffolds with more
features that build on the baseline. To use one of them, merge it into the main branch, then delete all the other branches.

### Example

After creating the new repository, open a PR from the desired more advanced scaffold branch into the main branch, then squash and merge it (make sure you select "squash & merge"). Et voilÃ  - the project is ready to go!

In the bash command line, this flow would look like this:
```sh
# replace XXX with the repo name that you created in the `Usage` section
> git clone https://github.com/sidestream-tech/XXX

# see all available feature branche
> git branch -a

# merge the desired more advanced scaffold version
> git merge --squash fullstack-nuxt3

# commit and push the merge
> git commit -am 'scaffold repository with fullstack nuxt3 scaffold'
> git push
```
